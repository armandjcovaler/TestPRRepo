# TestPRRepo

## PR Rules
	The dev who created the PR is responsible for:
		1) Requesting reviews
		2) Resolving/implementing comments
		3) Ensuring the build and tests pass
		4)  Once all parties are happy then the dev who created the PR does the merge.
    At its core the dev who creates the PR is going to be held responsible for that code along with the reviewers who approved.
